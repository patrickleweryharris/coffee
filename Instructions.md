# Coffee Gif Browser

## Getting Started

The application is live [here](https://mysterious-crag-44463.herokuapp.com/#/)

If you want to run the application locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/csc309-18s/assignment-3-coffee.git
$ cd assignment-3-coffee
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Your browser should now open the URL `localhost:3000`; where our app lives. A window may pop up asking you to allow incoming connections.
Please click 'yes'.
